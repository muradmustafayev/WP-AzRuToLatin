This plugin converts Azeri and Russian character in post slugs to Latin characters.

== Description ==

** Rewritten and inspired from [Az-To-Lat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/aztolat/) and [Cyr to Lat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cyr2lat/)**

* Converts Azerbaijani and Russian characters in post slugs to Latin characters. Very useful for Azerbaijani-Russian speaking users of WordPress.

*(Aydin's notes) The original author of this plugin is Anton Skorobogatov, who passed away prematurely in 2007. I decided to make it available for installation through the Plugin Browser/Installer. I take no credit for the creation of this plugin.*

Thanks to Aydin Cavadli for the idea.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `aztolat` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
